# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

The curriculum of statistics has reached a point of being redesigned and redeveloped to prevent a continuation of abstinences based outreach. It is suggested that the newly developed curriculum is to provide students with the skills needed to practice safe-stats. According to Wickham, a vital component to safe-stats is to develop grammars of data analysis, which will allow users to access a set of independent components and a method to solving the list of problems within a domain. The grammar then needs to be embedded in a programming language.
